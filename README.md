# **Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction (Logistic Regression)**
<sub><i>Binary classification to predict diabetes likelihood using clinical measurements</i></sub>

---

## **Project Overview**
In this notebook, we use **Logistic Regression** to model the **Pima Indians Diabetes** dataset and predict which individuals are likely to develop **diabetes**.

This dataset originates from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)**. The goal is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements.
